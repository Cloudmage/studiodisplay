# Credits

This software was created by Matthias C. Hormann ([@Moonbase59](https://twitter.com/Moonbase59), <mhormann@gmx.de>).  
It is maintained at: [https://github.com/Moonbase59/studiodisplay](https://github.com/Moonbase59/studiodisplay).

StudioDisplay would not have been possible without all of you contributing to the idea
of freely sharing wisdom and knowledge and making your software and art available
as Free and Open Source Software. **Thank you all.**

## IDJC, the Internet DJ Console

A professional Linux web radio broadcasting software that somehow inspired me
to start all this. IDJC has been a trusted companion for many a year now,
and the author, Stephen Fairchild, is always responsive, helpful
and open for new ideas.

You’ll find it at [http://idjc.sourceforge.net/](http://idjc.sourceforge.net/).
